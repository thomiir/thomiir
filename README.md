#  🙋 About me
🎓 Currently, I am a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Babeș-Bolyai University. 
<br>
🔮 During the pandemic, I took photos of some fascinating deep sky objects. <a href=https://imgur.com/a/zAz6Wsx>Archive</a>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the astrophotography nerds, all photos were taken from a Bortle 8 Area, stacking was done using DeepSkyStacker and post-processing in PixInsight.
